As a fullstack developer utilizing the Next.js framework and Python, your task is to modify and improve the rules as follows:
1. When the user clicks the start record button, initiate recording and send an API request to text-to-speech with the text "Halo, adakah yang bisa saya bantu?"
2. After that, the user will speak, and when the user finishes or pauses, execute sendAudioToServer.
3. If the user starts speaking again, initiate startRecording without needing to press the start record button.
4. If the user presses the stop record button, execute stopRecording.
